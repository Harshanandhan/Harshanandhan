## About Me

Cybersecurity Analyst with a strong foundation in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, specializing in intelligent threat detection, automated security analysis, and next-generation defense systems. I leverage AI-driven approaches to enhance vulnerability assessment, anomaly detection, and security automation—combining traditional cybersecurity practices with cutting-edge machine learning techniques.
My expertise spans building intelligent security solutions: from developing automated threat hunting workflows using SIEM platforms like Splunk to implementing ML-based anomaly detection for network traffic analysis. I apply data science principles to security operations—analyzing massive log datasets, identifying attack patterns through statistical modeling, and creating predictive models for threat intelligence.
Experienced in both traditional security operations and emerging technologies, including blockchain security where I audit smart contracts and analyze decentralized systems for vulnerabilities. My AI background enables me to understand and secure machine learning models against adversarial attacks, data poisoning, and model manipulation—critical skills as AI systems become increasingly integrated into enterprise infrastructure.
Proficient in automating security workflows with Python, implementing AI-powered detection rules, and leveraging frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK for threat modeling. I focus on scalable, data-driven security solutions that adapt to evolving threat landscapes through continuous learning and automation.
Currently seeking opportunities to apply AI and machine learning to cybersecurity challenges—building intelligent defense systems, developing automated threat detection platforms, and securing AI-powered applications in dynamic environments.
